    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C).</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and 1/4 cup sugar. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan to form the crust. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and let cool.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Add 1 1/4 cups sugar and vanilla extract to the cream cheese, mixing until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition until just combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in the sour cream and lemon juice (if using) until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the cream cheese mixture over the cooled crust in the springform pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 60-70 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center is still slightly jiggly.</li>
        <li>Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door slightly ajar for about 1 hour to cool gradually.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature before refrigerating for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Serve chilled, optionally topped with fruit or fruit sauce.</li>
    </ol>
